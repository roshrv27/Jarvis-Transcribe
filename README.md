## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation (3 Steps)

1. **Download the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jarvis-voice
   ```

2. **Run the installer**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Install required dependencies (Homebrew, Python packages)
   - Download the Whisper AI model (~150MB)
   - Set up the app

3. **Grant permissions** (macOS will ask)
   - **Microphone** - To hear your voice
   - **Accessibility** - To type into other apps
   
   Go to: System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Grant access

### Usage

**Launch from Terminal:**
```bash
~/Applications/JarvisVoice/start.sh
```

**Or create an alias for easy access:**
```bash
echo 'alias jarvis-transcribe="~/Applications/JarvisVoice/start.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
# Then just type: jarvis-transcribe
```

**How to use:**
1. Click where you want text to appear
2. **Double-tap OPTION key** (⌥⌥) quickly
3. **Speak** - red pill window appears
4. **Release OPTION** - text appears automatically!

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit settings in `~/.jarvisvoice/config.json`:

```json
{
  "hotkey": "alt_double",     // Options: "alt_double", "ctrl", "alt", "cmd"
  "model_size": "base",       // Options: "tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large-v3"
  "language": "en",           // Language code (en, es, fr, de, etc.)
  "auto_paste": false,        // Auto-add space after text
  "typing_delay": 0.01        // Delay before typing (seconds)
}
```

### Changing the Hotkey

**Option 1: Double-tap OPTION key** (default)
- Tap OPTION twice quickly to start
- Release to stop

**Option 2: Hold a key**
Change config to: `"hotkey": "ctrl"` or `"alt"` or `"cmd"`
- Hold the key while speaking
- Release to type

### Available Models

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| tiny | ~39MB | ⚡ Fastest | Basic |
| base | ~150MB | ⚡ Fast | Good ✅ (default) |
| small | ~466MB | 🐢 Slower | Better |
| medium | ~1.5GB | 🐢 Slow | High |
| large-v3 | ~3GB | 🐌 Slowest | Best |

**Recommendation:** Use `base` for best speed/accuracy balance

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Text not appearing"
- Grant **Accessibility** permission in System Preferences
- Grant **Microphone** permission in System Preferences
- Launch from Terminal, not Spotlight

### "App only works from Terminal"
This is expected! macOS security requires Terminal permissions. Always launch via:
```bash
~/Applications/JarvisVoice/start.sh
```

### "Permission denied" errors
Run the installer again:
```bash
./install.sh
```

### "Model not loading"
The model will download automatically on first run (~150MB). Be patient!
